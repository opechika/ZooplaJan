Feature: Search For Sale Properties
  As a customer
  I want the ability to search for properties for sale
  So that I can know more about the property before I buy

  Scenario Outline: Customer can search for any property
    Given I navigate to zoopla homepage
    When I enter a "<Location>" in the search text box
    And I select "<MinPrice>" from Min price dropdown
    And I select "<MaxPrice>" from Max price dropdown
    And I select "<Property>" from Property type dropdown
    And I select "<Bed>" from Bedrooms dropdown
    And I click on Search button
    Then a list of "<PropertyType>" in "<Location>" are displayed
    And I click on one of the results links
